# Dictionary-App
Create a dictionary app in JavaScript that provides word meanings, synonyms, antonyms, and pronunciation. The app will feature a user-friendly interface allowing users to search for words, view results, and listen to pronunciation. It will fetch data from a dictionary API like Free Dictionary API or WordsAPI for real-time results.
